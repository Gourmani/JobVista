Perfect 👍
You’re absolutely right — a real learner always asks for **full file-by-file understanding**.

I’ll now give you a **complete documentation (file-wise explanation)**
in clean format so you can copy into a file and keep forever.

Save this as:

> 📄 `JOB_MARKET_PROJECT_FULL_DOC.md`

Read slowly. This is your interview weapon.

# 🧠 JOB MARKET INTELLIGENCE PROJECT

## Complete Technical Documentation (File-by-File)

---

# 🔵 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is an end-to-end job market analysis system that:

1. Scrapes job postings from website
2. Stores data in database
3. Extracts required skills
4. Analyzes demand
5. Displays dashboard

It helps job seekers understand:

* Which skills are trending
* Which locations have more jobs
* What to learn next

# 🔵 4. FILE-BY-FILE EXPLANATION

---

# 📁 main.py

## Purpose: Main controller of project

This file connects everything.

### What it does:

1. Calls scraper
2. Gets job data
3. Stores in database
4. Runs skill extraction
5. Prints summary

### Flow inside main.py:

```python
print("Starting Job Market Pipeline")
```

Then:

```python
scraper.fetch_jobs()
```

Fetch job data.

Then:

```python
db.insert_jobs(jobs)
```

Store into database.

Then:

```python
skill_extractor.extract_skills()
```

Analyze skills.

---

### Interview explanation:

> main.py acts as the central pipeline controller that connects scraping, storage, and analysis modules.

---

# 📁 core/parser.py

## Purpose: Web scraping engine

This file scrapes job data from website.

---

### Step 1: Send request

```python
response = requests.get(URL)
```

Downloads HTML page.

---

### Step 2: Parse HTML

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```

Converts HTML → searchable structure.

---

### Step 3: Find job cards

```python
job_cards = soup.find_all("div", class_="card-content")
```

Each card = one job.

---

### Step 4: Extract fields

```python
title = job.find("h2").text
company = job.find("h3").text
location = job.find("p").text
```

---

### Step 5: Create job object

```python
JobPosting(title, company, location...)
```

Return list of jobs.

---

### Interview line:

> Implemented web scraping using requests and BeautifulSoup to extract job data from HTML structure.

---

# 📁 db/models.py

## Purpose: Data structure for jobs

We created class:

```python
@dataclass
class JobPosting:
```

This represents one job.

Fields:

* title
* company
* location
* description
* experience
* salary
* source

---

### Why needed?

Instead of messy dictionary:
We use structured object.

This is called:

> Data Modeling

Interview line:

> Designed a structured JobPosting data model using dataclass.

---

# 📁 db/database.py

## Purpose: Database operations

Uses SQLite database.

---

### Why SQLite?

* Lightweight
* No installation
* Good for projects

---

### Functions inside:

## create_table()

Creates jobs table if not exists.

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs(...)
```

---

## insert_jobs(jobs)

Stores scraped jobs.

```python
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO jobs...")
```

---

## fetch_all_jobs()

Reads jobs for dashboard.

---

### Interview line:

> Used SQLite for persistent storage and efficient retrieval of scraped data.

---

# 📁 data/seed_skills.json

## Purpose: Skill database

Contains list:

```
python
sql
java
react
aws
machine learning
```

Acts like:

> Skill dictionary

Used to match skills in job descriptions.

---

# 📁 core/skill_extractor.py

## Purpose: Skill analysis engine

Most important logic.

---

### Step 1: Load skill list

```python
with open(seed_skills.json)
```

---

### Step 2: For each job description

Convert to lowercase:

```python
desc = job.description.lower()
```

---

### Step 3: Match skills

```python
for skill in skills:
    if skill in desc:
        skill_count[skill] += 1
```

Counts frequency.

Output:

```
Python → 25 jobs
SQL → 18 jobs
```

---

### Concept used:

Keyword-based NLP (Natural Language Processing)

---

### Interview line:

> Implemented rule-based NLP skill extraction using keyword matching on job descriptions.

---

# 📁 app/dashboard.py

## Purpose: Frontend dashboard

Built using Streamlit.

---

### What it shows:

* Total jobs
* Companies hiring
* Location analysis
* Skill demand chart
* Filters

---

### How it works:

Step 1: Fetch data from DB

```python
db.fetch_all_jobs()
```

Step 2: Convert to pandas dataframe

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
```

Step 3: Run skill extractor

Step 4: Create charts

Using:

* Streamlit charts
* Plotly charts

---

### Filters added:

* Location filter
* Skill filter
* Company filter
* Experience filter

This makes dashboard interactive.

---

# 📁 jobs.db

## Purpose: SQLite database file

Stores all scraped jobs.

Table:

```
jobs
```

Columns:

* id
* title
* company
* location
* description
* experience
* salary
* source

---

# 📁 requirements.txt

## Purpose: Dependency list

Contains:

```
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
streamlit
plotly
sqlalchemy
lxml
```

Anyone can run project using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 🔵 INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (USE THIS)

If interviewer asks:

### Explain your project:

> I developed an end-to-end job market intelligence system that scrapes job postings, stores them in a database, analyzes skill demand using NLP, and visualizes insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

# 🔵 CURRENT LIMITATION

Currently using demo job data.

Next step:

> Real job scraping (RemoteOK/Internshala)

Then dashboard becomes powerful.

---

# 🧠 Final question (important)
